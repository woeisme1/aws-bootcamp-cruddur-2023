# Week 0 — Billing and Architecture

There was alot to go through this week! I watched all the Week 00 bootcamp videos and got familiarised with the project 'CRUDDUR', what the scope of it was, considerations going into it and lessons to learn going into this bootcamp: manage my time and effort; understand theres going to be unique tradeoffs in my project (IRON TRIANGLE!); be comfortable learning, iterating and showing back.

Chris Williams went through what makes a good architecture:
•	Meets requirements (technical or business need)
    o	Verifiable
    o	Monitorable
    o	Traceable
    o	Feasible
•	Address risks, assumptions and constraints
    o	Risks that prevent project from being successful
    o Single Point of Failure (SPoF)
    o User commitment
    o Late delivery
•	Assumptions held as true for planning and implementation
    o Sufficient network bandwidth
    o	Stakeholders available to make decisions
    o Budget is approved
•	Constraints are policy or technical limitations for projects
    o Time
    o Budget
    o Vendor selection

RRAC - Requirements, risks, assumptions and constraints.
Chris stressed the importance of asking dumb questions. They will help develop a common dictionary between all stakeholders.

Ashish Rajan went through security considerations and best practices. Its so important as security protects networks, apps and environments and help reduce human error. As well as protection against threat actors. As a result of his video IAM USers, Organizations, MFA, Billing Alarms (I want to create this as cheap as possible!) and budgets were all made.

## Required Homework

Completed:creating a budget, creating a billing alarm,  installed AWS CLI, creating IAM Users and created a logical lucid diagram.
